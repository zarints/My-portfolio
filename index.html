            <h3>Blue humanoid creatures</h3>
            <p>The Smurfs (French: Les Schtroumpfs; Dutch: De Smurfen) is a Belgian comic franchise centered on a
                fictional
                colony of small, blue, humanoid creatures who live in mushroom-shaped houses in the forest. There are
                more than 100 Smurf
                characters, and their names are based on adjectives that emphasise their characteristics, such as "Jokey
                Smurf", who likes to play practical jokes on his fellow smurfs.</p>

            <p>A blue moon is a rare astronomical event of second appearance of the full-moon during one month, usually
                with the moon turning blue. In the comic books and the cartoon show, it is used to indicate when a baby
                Smurf is about to be delivered to the Smurf Village.</p>

                <h3>Guides and takes care of everyone</h3>
                <p>Papa Smurf is one of the protagonists from the comic strip the Smurfs.[1] Most Smurfs are said to be
                    about 100 years old, but at the advanced age of 546, Papa is the oldest Smurf and the leader of all
                    Smurfs. Despite his age, he is still quite energetic. Easily distinguishable from all the other
                    Smurfs,
                    Papa Smurf has a bushy white mustache and beard and is typically dressed in red pants and a matching
                    red
                    Phrygian cap, making him the only Smurf who does not wear white.</p>

                <h1>Brainy smurf</h1>
                <h3>The intelligent one</h3>
                <p>Brainy is the village intellectual who's not afraid to share his "wisdom" with his fellow Smurfs,
                    even
                    though it usually results in his being booted to the village limits or whacked in the head with a
                    mallet. He is also a very prolific author of many books, usually with his name in the title, and he
                    is
                    Papa Smurf's apprentice and assistant in his laboratory. He is easily identifiable by his glasses
                    and
                    his books.</p>
