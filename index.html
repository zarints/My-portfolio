            <h3>Blue humanoid creatures</h3>
            <p>The Smurfs (French: Les Schtroumpfs; Dutch: De Smurfen) is a Belgian comic franchise centered on a
                fictional
                colony of small, blue, humanoid creatures who live in mushroom-shaped houses in the forest. There are
                more than 100 Smurf
                characters, and their names are based on adjectives that emphasise their characteristics, such as "Jokey
                Smurf", who likes to play practical jokes on his fellow smurfs.</p>

            <h3>A blessing</h3>
            <p>A blue moon is a rare astronomical event of second appearance of the full-moon during one month, usually
                with the moon turning blue. In the comic books and the cartoon show, it is used to indicate when a baby
                Smurf is about to be delivered to the Smurf Village.</p>
